Work in progress:
1. Compute call graph partitions
2. Fixed points for loops and recursion

Improvements:
1. a = b
2. NULL pointers
3. global variables
4. extern functions
5. Distinguish v_i for different functions

Harder:
1. References [4] and [8] (fully path-sensitive and field sensitive)
2. Fast alias environment computation
3. Simplify constraints
4. Parallelism
5. Graphical output

Not important:
1. Alias entry assertions
2. Other data types (intergrals, floats)
